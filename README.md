# hello-world
using github for the first time as a business person

Hi! I am a business person trying to learn some programing. I am tired of always asking programmers to code something for me so I will take the matter into my own hands! Let's start this! 


Also today my grandfather died. I am incredibily sad but also somehow motivated. I hope you rest well good man. Imi va fi dor de tine...defapt...mereu mi-a fost. Te iubesc si te voi iubi mereu. Ne vedem mai tarziu, mai am ceva treaba pe aici.
